# TECHNICAL PROJECTS

Practicum Bootcamp – Hybrid app testing (Urban Scooter)

o	Using the command console, I connected to a remote server where the scooter-delivery app is stored.
o	I carefully analyzed the app’s documentation, which involved identifying its requirements, the structure of its API, and designs.
o	I designed a battery of manual and automated tests that tested password fields, order parameters, user parameters, user interaction, etc.
o	I interacted with the app’s web-based and mobile components, using various tools to engage both the back-end and front-end of the app.
o	I tested the mobile component using a combination of Android Studio and DevTools, while simultaneously interacting with the app’s API to create users and orders, modifying the app’s database, and sending various requests using Postman.
o	I ensured that the app’s functionality met the designers and developers’ expectations (outlined in the app’s documentation), while also taking note of the user experience, identifying aspects that could be improved.
o	I created bug-tracking documentation using JIRA, identifying 74 bugs. I dutifully specified the environment, preconditions, steps, and screenshots necessary for the development team to easily localize the bugs and squash them.

Practicum Bootcamp – Automatization tests (Urban Routes)
o	I tested the functionality of an urban taxi app, employing Selenium and Python to design automatized requests in PyCharm.
o	I tested the functionality of various buttons and fields according to a predetermined checklist.
o	Git project: https://github.com/Bloodwrought/qa-project-Urban-Routes-es.git (README file is in Spanish).
